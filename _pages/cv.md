## Research Experience

- 2023.12 -- 2024.12 Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program: Development of Power Allocation and Data Rate Control System for Semi-Physical Simulation Platform in Interplanetary Network

Adviser: Zuqing Zhu(IEEE Fellow, Professer of USTC)

Get Grade A(GPA: 4.0)

**Brief introduction:**

This study develops a semi-physical simulation platform for interplanetary networks (IPN) using the Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION) platform, which introduces a novel mechanism for status exchange between nodes,enabling status updates, message parsing, and data rate adjustments based on queue thresholds.
